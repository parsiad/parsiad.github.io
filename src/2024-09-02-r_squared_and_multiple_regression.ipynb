    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The *R squared* of a predictor $\\hat{Y}$ relative to a target $Y$ is the proportion of the variation in the target that is explained by that predictor.\n",
    "In this short note, we introduce the R squared in its most general form.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then turn our attention to predictors constructed by ordinary least squares (OLS) with an intercept term and prove that in this case, on the training set, R squared is equal to the square of the correlation between the predictor and target.\n",
    "This fact is well-known but a proof outside of the case of a single independent variable (a.k.a. [simple linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression)) is hard to find."

    "## R squared\n",

    "As mentioned above, the R squared is a fraction of variation.\n",
    "A natural notion of variation between two random quantities is the mean squared error:\n",

    "The *mean squared error* (MSE) between real random variables $A$ and $B$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\operatorname{MSE}(A, B) \\equiv \\mathbb{E}[(A - B)^2].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to define R squared:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition (R squared).**\n",
    "Let $Y$ and $\\hat{Y}$ be real random variables. The *R squared* of $\\hat{Y}$ relative to $Y$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^2(Y, \\hat{Y})\n",
    "\\equiv 1 - \\frac{\\operatorname{MSE}(Y,\\hat{Y})}{\\operatorname{Var}(Y)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Written in the above form, the R squared has an intuitive definition: it is equal to one minus the fraction of unexplained variation (note that the variance itself is a special case of the MSE since $\\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\operatorname{MSE}(Y,\\mathbb{E}Y)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following facts can be verified by direct substitution into the definition of R squared:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact.**\n",
    "*A \"perfect\" prediction (i.e., $\\operatorname{MSE}(Y,\\hat{Y})=0$) has an R squared of one.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact.**\n",
    "*A prediction of the mean (i.e., $\\hat{Y}=\\mathbb{E}Y)$ has an R squared of zero.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The above give us an upper bound (one) and a \"weak\" lower bound (zero) for the R squared.\n",
    "The lower bound is weak in the sense that it is possible to produce predictors that have a negative R squared but that such predictors are typically pathological as they are worse (in the sense of R squared) than simply predicting the mean."

    "This results in two distinct expectations: $\\mathbb{E}$ and $\\mathbb{E}_H$ ($H$ for \"hold out\").\n",
    "In the context of R squared, this results in two natural quantities: $R^2$ and $R_H^2$ where the latter is defined by replacing all expectations $\\mathbb{E}$ in the MSE and variance by $\\mathbb{E}_H$.\n",
    "We stress that the results of this section apply only to the former.\n",
