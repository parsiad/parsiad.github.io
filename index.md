I am a VP at [PDT Partners](https://pdtpartners.com), a fund in New York City.
Previously, I worked at [Google LLC](http://google.com) in Mountain View, California.
Prior to that, I was a Research Post-Doctoral Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) under the mentorship of [Erhan Bayraktar](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/erhan/).

I hold a PhD from the [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the University of Waterloo, completed under the supervision of Professor [George Labahn](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~glabahn/).
My academic work focused on both the theory and numerics of continuous-time optimal stochastic control and viscosity solutions ([this monograph](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4286-8) gives a good introduction to the theory).

You can reach me at `{{ site.hidden_email }}`

A CV is available on request.

My [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős_number) is 4: Me → [G. Labahn](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~glabahn/) → [G. H. Golub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_H._Golub) → [A. J. Hoffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_J._Hoffman) → [P. Erdős](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s).

For fun, I wrote a short [script to generate an academic genealogy graph](https://github.com/parsiad/math-genealogy-graph) using data from the [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/).
Mine is below.
