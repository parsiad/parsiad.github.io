title: Octave Financial 0.5.0 released
---
I am happy to announce the release of the GNU Octave Financial package version 0.5.0. This is the *first* release since I took on the role of maintainer.

If you do not already have GNU Octave, you can [grab a free copy here](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html).

To install the package, launch Octave and run the following commands:

```
pkg install -forge io
pkg install -forge financial
```

Perhaps the most exciting addition in this version is the Monte Carlo simulation framework, which is significantly faster than its MATLAB counterpart. A brief tutorial (along with benchmarking information) are available in [a previous post](/blog/2015/sdes_and_monte_carlo_in_octave_financial). Other additions include Black-Scholes options and greeks valuation routines, implied volatility calculations, and general bug fixes. Some useful links for GNU Octave Financial are below:
