title: An introduction to the curiously recurring template pattern
---
## Motivation

The curiously recurring template pattern (CRTP) is a C++ polymorphism technique allowing a base class to access derived class members without virtual table lookups.
This is accomplished via [template metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming).

Note that aggressive applications of template metaprogramming can often be a form of premature optimization, reducing the readability of a code base.
We do *not* claim that CRTP should be used whenever possible but rather that it *can* be useful in certain contexts.
For example, [the Eigen library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) uses CRTP to implement [expression templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_templates) in order to optimize its usage.

In this short post, we demonstrate how to use CRTP to remove occurrences of the virtual keyword from a toy example.

## Virtual polymorphism

Consider the following abstract class:

```c++
class Animal {
  string name;
  virtual const vector<string> &get_sounds() const = 0;

public:
  Animal(const string &name) : name(name) {}
  string get_random_sound(mt19937 &gen) const {
    const auto &sounds = this->get_sounds();
    uniform_int_distribution<> dist(0, sounds.size() - 1);
    return sounds[dist(gen)];
  }
  string get_name() const { return name; }
};
```

Its job is simple: whenever `get_random_sound` is called, the animal produces one of a finite number of sounds.
The sound is chosen randomly from a list of sounds the animal is able to make.

Lets add some animals:

```c++
class Cat : public Animal {
  const vector<string> &get_sounds() const override {
    static const vector<string> sounds = {"hiss", "meow"};
    return sounds;
  }

public:
  Cat(const string &name) : Animal(name) {}
};

class Dog : public Animal {
  const vector<string> &get_sounds() const override {
    static const vector<string> sounds = {"bark", "growl", "whine"};
    return sounds;
  }

public:
  Dog(const string &name) : Animal(name) {}
};
```

Finally, let's have some animals produce some sounds:

```c++
int main() {
  random_device rd;
  mt19937 gen(rd());

  vector<unique_ptr<Animal>> animals;
  animals.emplace_back(make_unique<Cat>("Charlie"));
  animals.emplace_back(make_unique<Dog>("Daisy"));

  for (auto &animal : animals) {
    cout << animal->get_name() << ": " << animal->get_random_sound(gen) << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Running this program, we might see output such as the following:

```
Charlie: meow
Daisy: whine
```

## CRTP polymorphism

Now, let's translate our implementation to CRTP.
The main idea in CRTP is to template the base class as `Base<Derived>` (in our case, the base class is `Animal`) in order to access the members of the derived class from the base class code.
Below is our revised base class.

```c++
template <typename Derived> class Animal {
  string name;

public:
  Animal(const string &name) : name(name) {}
  string get_name() const { return name; }
  string get_random_sound(mt19937 &gen) const {
    const auto &sounds = static_cast<const Derived &>(*this).get_sounds();
    uniform_int_distribution<> dist(0, sounds.size() - 1);
    return sounds[dist(gen)];
  }
};
```

Casts of the form `static_cast<const Derived &>(*this)` are common to CRTP code: this is because `this` is a pointer to the base class and we need to be able to treat it like a pointer to the derived class in order to access members of the derived class.

Next, let's port our derived classes:

```c++
class Cat : public Animal<Cat> {
public:
  static const vector<string> &get_sounds() {
    static const vector<string> sounds = {"hiss", "meow"};
    return sounds;
  }

public:
  Cat(const string &name) : Animal(name) {}
};

class Dog : public Animal<Dog> {
public:
  static const vector<string> &get_sounds() {
    static const vector<string> sounds = {"bark", "growl", "whine"};
    return sounds;
  }

public:
  Dog(const string &name) : Animal(name) {}
};
```

To avoid virtual table lookups, we use [`variant`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant) and [`visit`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant/visit) to iterate through the animals:

```c++
int main() {
  random_device rd;
  mt19937 gen(rd());

  vector<variant<Cat, Dog>> animals;
  animals.emplace_back(Cat("Charlie"));
  animals.emplace_back(Dog("Daisy"));

  for (const auto &animal : animals) {
    visit(
        [&gen](const auto &a) {
          cout << a.get_name() << ": " << a.get_random_sound(gen) << endl;
        },
        animal);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

## Further reading

While the above example is useful in introducing CRTP, the interested reader is encouraged to read about [expression templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_templates) to see a more realistic application of CRTP.
