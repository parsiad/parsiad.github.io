title: Introduction to the FFT
---
## Motivation

The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is a transformation that converts a signal from its original domain (e.g., time or space) into a [frequency domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain).
The DFT has widespread applicability (e.g., data compression, filtering, partial differential equations, etc.).
However, if the DFT is computed naively, the amount of work required to transform a signal with $n$ elements is $O(n^2)$ [FLOPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS).

A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is any one of a family of algorithms that can compute the DFT in $O(n \lg n)$ FLOPs.
The widespread adoption of the DFT is, without a doubt, due to the FFT.

This article introduces the theory of the DFT and FFT and gives some examples in Python.

## Notation

$i$ denotes the [imaginary unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit).
The [complex conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate) of a complex number $z$ is denoted $z^\dagger$.

Throughout, this article, we fix our choice of $n$ and work with the complex vector space $\mathbb{C}^n$.
When the vector space is not made explicit in writing, it should be assumed that it is this one.
The [conjugate transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_transpose) $\boldsymbol{z}^\mathrm{H}$ of a complex vector or matrix $\boldsymbol{z}$ is obtained by taking the ordinary [transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose) and conjugating each entry.
An inner product is obtained by defining $\langle \boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v} \rangle = \boldsymbol{v}^{\mathrm{H}} \boldsymbol{u}$.
The induced norm is $|\boldsymbol{u}| = \sqrt{\langle \boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{u} \rangle}$.

The [Kronecker delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta) $\delta_{jj^\prime}$ is defined to be one whenever $j = j^\prime$ and zero otherwise.

## Discrete Fourier Transform

### Roots of unity

**Definition (Roots of unity).**
A complex number $z$ satisfying $z^n = 1$ is called an $n$-th root of unity.

**Lemma.**
If $z$ is an $n$-th root of unity, so too is $z^u$ for any complex number $u$.

*Proof*.
$z^u = (z^u)^n = z^{nu} = (z^n)^u = 1^u = 1.$

For the remainder, let $\omega = \exp(-2 \pi i / n)$.

**Corollary.**
$\omega^0, \ldots, \omega^{n - 1}$ are the only $n$-th roots of unity.

*Proof*.
It's readily verified by direct computation that $\omega^0, \ldots, \omega^{n - 1}$ are distinct $n$-th roots of unity.
Uniqueness follows from the [fundamental theorem of algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra) applied to $z^n - 1$.

**Lemma.**
Let $n$ be a positive integer and $z \neq 1$ be an $n$-th root of unity.
Then $z^0 + \cdots + z^{n - 1} = 0$.

*Proof*.
The sum is a (finite) geometric series and hence $(1 - z) (z^0 + \cdots + z^{n - 1}) = 1 - z^n$, from which the desired result follows.

### Forward and inverse transforms

**Theorem.**
Let

$$
    \boldsymbol{f}^{(j)}
    = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} ( \omega^0, \omega^j, \omega^{2j}, \ldots, \omega^{(n - 1)j} ).
$$

Then, the vectors $\boldsymbol{f}^{(0)}, \ldots, \boldsymbol{f}^{(n - 1)}$ form an orthonormal basis for $\mathbb{C}^n$.

*Proof*.
Let $j$ and $j^\prime$ be nonnegative integers strictly smaller than $n$.
By the previous lemma,

$$
      n \left \langle \boldsymbol{f}^{(j)}, \boldsymbol{f}^{(j^\prime)} \right \rangle
    = \omega^{(j - j^\prime) \cdot 0} + \cdots + \omega^{(j - j^\prime) \cdot (n - 1)}
    = n \delta_{jj^\prime}
$$

as desired.

The above establishes that the matrix $F$ whose rows are $\boldsymbol{f}^{(0)}, \ldots, \boldsymbol{f}^{(n - 1)}$ is [unitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix).
The matrix $F$ is called the *forward transform*.
Because this matrix is unitary, its conjugate transpose $F^{\mathrm{H}}$ is its inverse.
As such, we call the conjugate transpose the *inverse transform*.

*Remark*.
In the above, we used the scaling factor $n^{-1 / 2}$ to ensure that the matrix F was unitary, simplifying mathematical discussion.
The [NumPy definitions of forward and inverse transforms](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html#module-numpy.fft) do not use the same scaling factor (in particular, `numpy.fft.fft` uses $n^{1 / 2} F$ and hence the corresponding inverse transform `numpy.fft.ifft` uses $n^{-1 / 2} F^\mathrm{H}$ to ensure that the two functions are inverses of one another).
Software libraries have their own conventions when it comes to the scaling factors for forward and inverse transforms, so itâ€™s best to proceed carefully!

For the remainder, we employ the convention that if $\boldsymbol{z}$ is a vector, then the uppercase symbol $\boldsymbol{Z}$ is its forward transform.
That is, $\boldsymbol{Z} = F \boldsymbol{z}$.

### Some immediate results

**Theroem (Plancherel theorem).**
Let $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{v}$ be vectors.
Then, $\langle \boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v} \rangle = \langle \boldsymbol{U}, \boldsymbol{V} \rangle$.

*Proof*.
$\langle \boldsymbol{U}, \boldsymbol{V} \rangle = \langle F \boldsymbol{v}, F \boldsymbol{v} \rangle = \boldsymbol{v}^{\mathrm{H}} F^{\mathrm{H}} F \boldsymbol{u} = \boldsymbol{v}^{\mathrm{H}} \boldsymbol{u} = \langle \boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v} \rangle$.

**Corollary (Parseval's theorem).**
Let $\boldsymbol{u}$ be a vector. Then, $|\boldsymbol{u}| = |\boldsymbol{U}|$.

The above result simply states that the original vector and its transform have the same Euclidean norm.

### Convolution

For integers $a$ and $b$ with $b$ nonnegative, denote $a \% b$ the least nonnegative residue of $a$ modulo $b$ (i.e., the usual definition of the operator `%` in many programming languages).
For a vector $\boldsymbol{u}$ with $n$ entries, we introduce the indexing convention $z_j = z_{j \% n}$ whenever $j$ is negative or at least as large $n$.

**Definition (Circular convolution).**
The circular convolution of vectors $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{v}$ is a vector $\boldsymbol{u} \star \boldsymbol{v}$ with entries $(\boldsymbol{u} \star \boldsymbol{v})_j = u_0 v_{j - 0} + \cdots + u_{n - 1} v_{j - (n - 1)}$.

Denote by $\odot$ the [element-wise product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product_(matrices)).

**Theorem (Convolution theorem).**
Let $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{v}$ be vectors.
Then, $F (\boldsymbol{u} \star \boldsymbol{v}) = \sqrt{n} (\boldsymbol{U} \odot \boldsymbol{V})$.

The above theorem tells us that the convolution of vectors $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{v}$ can be computed by

1. computing the DFTs $\boldsymbol{U}$ and $\boldsymbol{V}$,
2. multiplying these element-wise to get $\boldsymbol{Z} = \boldsymbol{U} \odot \boldsymbol{V}$, and
3. computing the inverse Fourier transform of $\sqrt{n} \boldsymbol{Z}$.

Similar results can be established for the circular [cross-correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation).

### Real signals

In practice, the input to the forward transform is often a real signal (i.e., a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$).
It is useful to derive some facts about such signals.

**Theorem (Conjugate symmetry).**
Let $\boldsymbol{x}$ be a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
Then, $X_j^\dagger = X_{n - j}$.

*Proof*.
First, note that
$\boldsymbol{X}^{\mathrm{H}}=(F\boldsymbol{x})^{\mathrm{H}}=\boldsymbol{x}^{\intercal}F^{\mathrm{H}}=((F^{\mathrm{H}})^{\intercal}\boldsymbol{x})^{\intercal}$.
Using the fact that $(\omega^{kj})^{\dagger}=\omega^{-kj}=\omega^{k(n-j)}$, the $j$-th row of $(F^{\mathrm{H}})^{\intercal}$ is $f^{(n-j)}$, from which the result follows.

The above tells us that for a real input $\boldsymbol{x}$, we need only compute the first $1 + \lfloor n / 2 \rfloor$ coordinates of $\boldsymbol{X}$.

*Remark*.
The [NumPy function `numpy.fft.rfft`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.fft.rfft.html#numpy.fft.rfft) takes advantage of this fact.

But what if we only have access to a "black box" function that computes the forward transform?
Can we still save on computation? The answer is provided by the corollary below.

**Corollary.**
Let $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$ be two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
Let $\boldsymbol{z} = \boldsymbol{x} + i\boldsymbol{y}$.
Then, $2 X_j = Z_j + Z_{n - j}^\dagger$ and $2 i Y_j = Z_j - Z_{n - j}^\dagger$.

In other words, the DFT of two real inputs $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$ can be computed by

1. creating a complex signal $\boldsymbol{z}$ whose real part is $\boldsymbol{x}$ and whose complex part is $\boldsymbol{y}$,
2. computing the DFT $\boldsymbol{Z}$, and
3. retrieving the individual DFTs $\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$ by the above formulas.


```python
import numpy as np


def fft_of_two_real_signals(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray):
    """Computes the FFT of two real signals using a single complex FFT.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: A real NumPy vector.
    y: A real NumPy vector.

    Returns
    -------
    X: The FFT of x.
    Y: The FFT of y.
    """
    z = x + 1j * y
    Z = np.fft.fft(z)
    Z_reverse_conj = np.conjugate(np.concatenate([[Z[0]], np.flip(Z[1:])]))
    X = (Z + Z_reverse_conj) * 0.5
    Y = (Z_reverse_conj - Z) * 0.5j
    return X, Y
```

## Fast Fourier transform

The [Cooley-Tukey algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm) is the most common FFT algorithm.
It re-expresses the DFT of an arbitrary composite size $n = ab$ in terms of smaller DFTs of sizes $a$ and $b$.

### Radix-2 algorithm

Assuming $n$ is even, the radix-2 algorithm corresponds to taking $a = b = n /2$.
The motivation comes from notating that

$$
    \sqrt{n}X_{k}
    =\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\omega^{jk}x_{j}
    =\sum_{j=0}^{n/2-1}\omega^{2jk}x_{2j}+\omega^{k}\sum_{j=0}^{n/2-1}\omega^{2jk}x_{2j+1}
$$

and hence $X_k = E_k + \omega^k O_k$ where $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{O}$ are DFTs of the even and odd parts of the original signal $\boldsymbol{x}$.
By expressing this relationship recursively, we obtain a natural $O(n \lg n)$ algorithm to compute the DFT.

## Image compression

Image compression is one possible application of the FFT.
It can be achieved by

1. transforming the image into the frequency domain,
2. dropping high-frequency components, and
3. saving the result.

To view the image, one must inverse transform back to the original domain.

Let's try it on an example image.

*Remark*. There are much better ways to compress images; the code below is purely demonstrational.


```python
from io import BytesIO
import requests

from typing import List, Tuple
import sys

from PIL import Image, ImageOps
import numpy as np

Lossy = Tuple[int, int, int, int, float, np.ndarray]


def _masks(height: int, width: int, freq: float) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    i = np.fft.fftfreq(height) <= freq
    j = np.fft.rfftfreq(width) <= freq
    return i, j


def image_to_lossy(image: Image, freq: float) -> Lossy:
    channel = np.array(image) / 255.0
    n_bytes = np.prod(channel.shape)
    height, width = channel.shape
    channel = np.fft.rfft2(channel)
    rows, cols = channel.shape
    i, j = _masks(height, width, freq)
    channel = channel[np.ix_(i, j)]
    channel = channel.astype(np.cfloat)
    n_bytes_compressed = np.prod(channel.shape) * 8  # 8 bytes per cfloat
    ratio = n_bytes_compressed / n_bytes
    sys.stderr.write(f"Compressed to {ratio * 100:.2f}% of original size\n")
    return height, width, rows, cols, freq, channel


def image_from_lossy(lossy: Lossy) -> Image:
    height, width, rows, cols, freq, lossy_channel = lossy
    i, j = _masks(height, width, freq)
    channel = np.zeros([rows, cols], dtype=np.cfloat)
    channel[np.ix_(i, j)] = lossy_channel
    channel = np.fft.irfft2(channel)
    channel = np.real(channel)
    channel = (channel * 255).astype(np.uint8)
    return Image.fromarray(channel)


url = "https://pixnio.com/free-images/2018/06/29/2018-06-29-23-01-01-1200x675.jpg"
response = requests.get(url)
image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
image = ImageOps.grayscale(image)

lossy = image_to_lossy(image, freq=0.1)
lossy_image = image_from_lossy(lossy)
```

    Compressed to 48.40% of original size
