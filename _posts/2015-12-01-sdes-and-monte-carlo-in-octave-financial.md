description: How to simulate stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and perform Monte Carlo integration using the GNU Octave Financial package.
---

This post is a tutorial on my fist major contribution as maintainer of [GNU Octave financial package](http://octave.sourceforge.net/financial/): a framework to simulate [stochastic differential equations (SDEs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation) of the form

$$dX_t = F(t, X_t) dt + G(t, X_t) dW_t$$

where *W* is a standard *n*-dimensional [Wiener process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process).

To follow along with the examples in this post you'll need a copy of GNU Octave and the Financial package. See the [release announcement post](/blog/2016/gnu-octave-financial-0-5-0-released/) for installation instructions.

## A one dimensional example: pricing a European call

A classic problem in finance is that of pricing a European [call option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_option). The price of a European call option with strike price *K* and expiry time *T* years from now is given by

$$\mathbb{E}\left[ e^{-rT} \max\{X_T - K, 0\} \right].$$

In the celebrated Black-Scholes framework, the functions *F* and *G* which parameterize the SDE are taken to be *F*(*t*, *X<sub>t</sub>*) = (*r* - ùõø) *X<sub>t</sub>* and *G*(*t*, *X<sub>t</sub>*) = ùúé *X<sub>t</sub>* where *r*, ùõø, and ùúé are the per-annum interest, dividend, and volatility rates of the stock *X*. In other words,

$$dX_t = \left(r - \delta\right) X_t dt + \sigma X_t dW_t.$$

When *F* and *G* are linear functions of the state variable (as they are in this case), the SDE is called a [Geometric Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion).

Approximating the above expectation using a sample mean is referred to as *Monte Carlo integration* or *Monte Carlo simulation*. Though the Black-Scholes pricing problem happens to be one in which a closed-form solution is known, as an expository example, let's perform Monte Carlo integration to approximate it using an SDE simulation:

```matlab
% Test parameters
X_0 = 100.; K = 100.; r = 0.04; delta = 0.01; sigma = 0.2; T = 1.;
Simulations = 1e6; Timesteps = 10;

SDE = gbm (r - delta, sigma, "StartState", X_0);
[Paths, ~, ~] = simByEuler (SDE, 1, "DeltaTime", T, "NTRIALS", Simulations, "NSTEPS", Timesteps, "Antithetic", true);

% Monte Carlo price
CallPrice_MC = exp (-r * T) * mean (max (Paths(end, 1, :) - K, 0.));

% Compare with the exact answer (Black-Scholes formula): 9.3197
```

The `gbm` function is used to generate an object describing geometric Brownian motion (GBM). Under the hood, it invokes the `sde` constructor, which is capable of constructing more general SDEs.

## Timing

The GNU Octave financial implementation uses broadcasting to speed up computation. Here is a speed comparison of the above with the MATLAB Financial Toolbox, under a varying number of timesteps:

| **Timesteps** | **MATLAB Financial Toolbox (secs.)** | **GNU Octave financial package (secs.)** |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 16            | 0.543231                             | 0.048691                                 |
| 32            | 1.053423                             | 0.064110                                 |
| 64            | 2.167072                             | 0.097092                                 |
| 128           | 4.191894                             | 0.162552                                 |
| 256           | 8.361655                             | 0.294098                                 |
| 512           | 16.609718                            | 0.568558                                 |
| 1024          | 32.839757                            | 1.136864                                 |

While both implementations scale more-or-less linearly, the GNU Octave financial package implementation greatly outperforms its MATLAB counterpart.

## A two dimensional example: pricing a European basket call

Consider now the basket call pricing problem

$$\mathbb{E}\left[ e^{-rT} \max\{\max\{X_T^1, X_T^2\} - K, 0\} \right]$$

involving two stocks *X<sup>1</sup>* and *X<sup>2</sup>* which follow the SDEs

$$dX_t^i = \left(r^i - \delta^i\right) X_t^i dt + \sigma^i X_t^i dW_t^i \qquad \text{for } i = 1,2.$$

To make matters more interesting, we also assume a correlation between the coordinates of the Wiener process:

$$dW_t^1 dW_t^2 = \rho dt.$$

Sample code for this example is below:

```matlab
% Test parameters
X1_0 = 40.; X2_0 = 40.; K = 40.; r = 0.05; delta1 = 0.; delta2 = 0.; sigma1 = 0.5; sigma2 = 0.5; T = 0.25; rho = 0.3;
Simulations = 1e5; Timesteps = 10;

SDE = gbm ([r-delta1 0.; 0. r-delta2], [sigma1 0.; 0. sigma2], "StartState", [X1_0; X2_0], "Correlation", [1 rho; rho 1]);
[Paths, ~, ~] = simulate (SDE, 1, "DeltaTime", T, "NTRIALS", Simulations, "NSTEPS", Timesteps, "Antithetic", true);

Max_Xi_T = max (Paths(end, :, :));
BasketCallPrice_MC = exp (-r * T) * mean (max (Max_Xi_T - K, 0.));

% Compare with the exact answer (Stulz 1982): 6.8477
```
